# Radiant Scheduler Extension


Created by: Sean Cribbs, September 2007

The Scheduler extension creates publish and expiration dates (or
appearance and disappearance) that are configurable by the content
editor.  These may be set in the "meta" area of the page editing
screen, and include a calendar-style date picker, thanks to Dan Webb's
wonderful LowPro library (and his date_selector behavior).  These
dates only affect what may be found from the 'live' site.  All pages
are accessible when in 'dev' or 'preview' mode.
   
## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Digital Pulp, Inc. for funding the initial development of this
extension as part of the Redken.com project.
